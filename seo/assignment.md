### 1. What is SEO and Explain the Importance of SEO?

**Answer:**

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of optimizing a website to improve its visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to attract more organic (non-paid) traffic to the site by ensuring that it ranks higher for relevant search queries.

**Importance of SEO:**

- **Increased Visibility:** Higher rankings in search results lead to increased visibility, making it more likely that users will visit the website.
- **Credibility and Trust:** Websites that appear at the top of search results are often perceived as more credible and trustworthy by users.
- **Cost-Effective Marketing:** Unlike paid advertising, organic traffic generated through SEO doesn't incur ongoing costs, making it a cost-effective long-term strategy.
- **Better User Experience:** SEO practices often lead to improved site usability, faster loading times, and mobile optimization, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Competitive Advantage:** By optimizing for SEO, a website can gain an edge over competitors who are not investing in search optimization.

### 4. Create an HTML Document that Properly Incorporates Semantic Elements

The following document uses elements like `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` to improve SEO and document structure.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Understanding Semantic HTML for Better SEO</title>
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="Learn how to use semantic HTML elements like header, nav, article, and section to improve SEO and document structure."
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Understanding Semantic HTML</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li>
          <li><a href="#benefits">Benefits of Semantic HTML</a></li>
          <li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section id="introduction">
        <article>
          <h2>What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that have meaning and
            describe the content they enclose. Examples include
            <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="benefits">
        <article>
          <h2>Benefits of Using Semantic HTML</h2>
          <p>
            Using semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and the overall
            structure of your web document, making it easier for both search
            engines and users to understand the content.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 Semantic HTML Guide</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 5. Define Favicon and Give an Illustrative Example

**Answer:**

**Favicon** (short for "favorite icon") is a small, square image or icon that represents a website and appears in the browser tab, bookmark list, or address bar. It helps users quickly identify a website visually and enhances brand recognition.

**Example:**

To add a favicon to your website, you can create a small 16x16 or 32x32 pixel image, save it as `favicon.ico`, and place it in your website's root directory. Then, include the following code in your HTML `<head>` section:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Website with Favicon</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This website has a custom favicon.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
