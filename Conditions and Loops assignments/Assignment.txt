Q1. What are conditionals statements? Explain conditionals statements with syntax and examples.

Ans : conditionals works on boolean values, true or false. it is true if it meets the requirement or false otherwise.

Types : 

1. If statement : the statement will only execute if the condition is evaluated to be true.
    if(condition){
        // statement
    }

2. If else statement : this contains an optional else statement to be evaluated in cause the statement is evaluated to be true.

        if(condition){
            //statement
        }
        else{
            statement
        }

3. Nested if - we can nest if else statement inside another if else statement

        if(condition){
             if(condition){
                // statement
             }
        }

4. if else if ladder - you can use multiple if else statements which allows you to chain multiple conditions together also called if else if ladder
 
        if(condition){
            // statement4
        }
        else if(condition){
            // statement3
        }
        else if(condition){
            // statement2
        }
        else(condition){
            // statement1
        }

Q2. Write a program that grades students based on their marks.
- If greater than 90 then A grade
- If between 70 and 90 then a B grade
- If between 50 and 70 then a C grade
- Below 50 then and F grade

Ans. 

const marks;
if(marks > 90)
console.log("A");

else if(marks <= 90 && marks >= 70)
console.log("B");

else if(marks <= 70 && marks >= 50)
console.log("C");

else
console.log("F");

Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans. Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many differnt kinds of loops soome of them are listed below.

1. For - Loop
2. Do - While Loop
3. While Loop

For Loop : for loop runs until the specicfied condition evaluates to false
Syntax : for (initialization; condition; afterthought){
          statement;
          }

example : 
let num = 1;
for(let i =0; i< 10; i++){
    console.log(num);
    num++;
}

Do - while loop 
Syntax : do
        {
         statement
        }
        while (condition);

the statement always executes once before the statement is condition is evaluated and after that it runs until the specified condition is evaluated false.

While Loop : this runs until the specified condition is evaluated false

syntax : while (condition){
            statement}


Q4. Generate numbers between any 2 given numbers.

Ans. 

const num1;
const num2;

for(let i  = num1; i <= num2; i++){
    console.log(i);
}

Q5. Use the while loop to print numbers from 1 to 25 in ascending and descending order.

Ans. let num = 1;

while(num <= 25){
    console.log(num);
    num++;
}
